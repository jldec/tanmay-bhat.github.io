<p>So, this will be like first non tech short blog from my side. here it goes .........</p>
  
  
<p>A cool evening, weather was perfect and I thought why not go for a bike ride and have something on the way. Ooopsie bad decision!</p>
  
  
<p>There I was, driving at around 50KMPH, all of sudden a cow came in middle of road, that too a black one, it was dark and I couldn't control and I crashed into it, BAM!!!</p>
  
  
<p>Cut to 30 min later, I'm in ER of a nearby hospital, had 6 bruises on my left side of my body, with a deep around 6cm cut on my left leg. Got the X-ray results and luckily no fracture and came back home.</p>
