<p>Then you can register for the training of an exam of your choice by searching it in the page.</p>
  
  
<p>So far I have seen that Microsoft offers free exam vouchers for all fundamentals exam i.e. Azure Data Fundamentals(<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/">DP-900</a>), Azure Fundamentals <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/#certification-exams">(AZ-900</a>), Azure AI fundamentals (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/">AI-900</a>).</p>
  
  
<p>Once you register the training and attend it, you can go to that certification website, schedule it through Pearson VUE. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If the email used to register for the event is the same as the MSA (Microsoft Account) email used for certification, You should see a banner to claim 100% free voucher, click <em>claim </em>to get that, like below.</p>
