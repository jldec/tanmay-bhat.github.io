<p>Ok, to be honest, I searched a lot on the internet to change ISP DNS servers to 3rd party servers (which you should !) for my router and couldn't find a direct article / steps to do that. Hence, this article.</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Steps to change the ISP DNS to 3rd party DNS :</strong></p>
  
  
<ol>
<li>Open the router login page, which is mostly : <strong><a href="http://192.168.1.1">192.168.1.1</a> </strong>in your case.</li>
<li>After logging in, navigate to Network page, Â LAN IP Address tab.</li>
<li>Change the <em>Lan Dns Mode</em> to : <strong>static</strong></li>
<li>Set the primary and secondary DNS address and click on Save/Apply.</li>
<li>Perform a reboot of router to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of DNS providers out there most of them for free. However, please be wise while choosing them.</p>
  
  
<p>I have chosen <span style="text-decoration:underline;">1.1.1.1 </span>DNS as my primary server which is provided by Cloudflare.</p>
  
  
<p>I have set the secondary  server to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">8.8.8.8 </span> which is provided by Google so that if one of the service is down, it will fallback to another.</p>
