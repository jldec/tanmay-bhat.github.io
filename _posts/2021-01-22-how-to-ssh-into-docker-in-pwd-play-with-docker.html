<p>Hey all ! For those of you who don't  know what PWD is below is short explanation :</p>
  
  
<p>So, PWD stands for Play With Docker. You can deploy &amp; learn docker at free with time limit of each instance up-to 10 Hrs!</p>
  
  
<p>For more info, go to :<a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">https://labs.play-with-docker.com/</a></p>
  
  
<p>There are two ways you can access the docker instance.</p>
  
  
<ol>
<li>Use the web based console.</li>
<li>SSH into that instance.</li>
</ol>
 
  
<p>I always love to do ssh as it gives me more freedom.</p>
  
  
<p>If you go straight away and do ssh from your terminal, you will get :</p>
  
<p><!-- wp:verse --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-verse">lab-suse:~/.ssh # ssh ip-x-x-x-@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com
ip-x-x-x-@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com: Permission denied (publickey).</pre>
<p><!-- /wp:verse --></p>
  
<p>Why are we getting this ? because there is no fresh key generated in your host.</p>
  
  
<p>Lets create a fresh key, run the below command :</p>
  
<p><!-- wp:preformatted --></p>
<pre id="block-f6743d5e-a71a-4af4-8b17-1637e21f28f9" class="wp-block-preformatted">lab-suse:~/.ssh# <code>ssh-keygen</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>
  
<p>After you complete the above command, try ssh again, it should work: </p>
  
<p><!-- wp:preformatted --></p>
<pre id="block-c1e67349-a5d7-4862-842b-58f3a507caf0" class="wp-block-preformatted">lab-suse:~/.ssh# ssh ip-x-x-x-@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com

 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

<p>Note : if you are using any ssh applications, save that key you generated to a file and load that file in authentication section. </p>
