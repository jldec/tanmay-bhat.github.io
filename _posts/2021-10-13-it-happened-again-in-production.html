<p>Previously I have written <a href="https://wp.me/pcknFJ-2F">article</a> about how AWS pushed broken image to Docker hub and we got screwed as we were using <em>latest</em> as image tag.</p>
  
  
<p>Welp, this happened again in our CI/CD pipeline as we were using <a href="https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push">push</a> plugin from helm and using that to push charts to <a href="https://chartmuseum.com/">chartmuseum</a>.</p>
  
  
<h4>How it happened?</h4>
   
  
<p>So we were using the below line to pull the helm push plugin :</p>
  
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>- helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push.git</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
  
<p>And were pushing to Chartmuseum via command : </p>
  
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm push app-name repo-name</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
  
<p>It turns out that command is not valid and as per their latest (v0.10.0) changes to the plugin, its been renamed to <strong>cm-push</strong> and we gotta use like <code>helm cm-push app-name repo-name</code>. Else we can use the same command with old version of plugin. </p>
  
  
<p>Hence our pipeline got screwed and I've fixed by pulling specific version from their repo by using -version argument. It goes like this : </p>
  
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push.git --version v0.9.0
</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
  
<p>The better solution to this is to replace the hard-coded version above to GitLab CI variable and update the version from there later.</p>
