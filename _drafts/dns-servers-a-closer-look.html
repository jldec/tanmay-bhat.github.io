<p>Hey everyone, today's topic is DNS servers; mainly 3rd party servers out there and how they benefit in day to day life compared to default ISP DNS servers.</p>
  
  
<p>Highly recommended explanation for how DNS servers work : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2jv11s/eli5how_do_dns_servers_work/clfcim8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a></p>
  
  
<p>Want a video instead ? Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Wj0od2ag5sk">here</a>.</p>
  
  
<p>Ok, now that you know how DNS servers work, lets take a look at default DNS servers provided by your ISP and why they do that instead of global one (like google)</p>
  
  
<p><strong>Reason</strong> : Unless the website you visit isn't <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/ssl/what-is-https/">HTTPS </a>(the green lock symbol left to website address) your ISP can see the data you send &amp; receive from a website. Shocking right ?</p>
  
  
<p>That is the reason <a href="https://serverguy.com/ssl/google-forcing-ssl-certificate-websites/">google is enforcing</a> all websites to use https instead of old tech: http</p>
  
  
<p><strong>What's in it for ISP : </strong>Basically your ISP can see which website you visit the most, make a profile on you, sell it for his Starbucks coffee! who  knows !</p>
  
  
<p>He can also restrict you from going to some of the websites which he wants, lets say some news articles, some protest details etc. He can also make your website load slower which can make you feel don't want to visit that website anymore ( if he wants to make you feel that way)</p>
